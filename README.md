# Codecademy_Programming_with_Python
Murder Mystery Project in Codecademy intensive course: Programming with Python (Jul 31, 2018 - Oct 16, 2018)

In this project we were tasked with building a new application for literature review. We had to make use of what we have learned through all of the course. Such as:

  <li>Data types</li>
  <li>Architecture</li>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Control flow</li>
